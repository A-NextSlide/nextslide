═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: THINK WEB, OUTPUT COMPONENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your canvas is 1920×1080px (presentation slide).

YOU WILL THINK in HTML/CSS patterns:
- Hero sections with dramatic backgrounds
- Card grids with glassmorphism  
- Split-screen layouts (50/50, 60/40, 70/30)
- Flexbox-style spacing and alignment
- Modern effects (backdrop-blur, gradients, shadows)

YOU WILL OUTPUT our component JSON:
- Background, Shape, TiptapTextBlock, Image, CustomComponent, etc.
- But designed with web patterns in mind

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 MODERN WEB DESIGN PATTERNS → COMPONENT MAPPING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PATTERN 1: HERO SECTION
Web thinking: Full-bleed gradient background + massive centered text
Components:
  → Background (gradient from theme colors)
  → TiptapTextBlock (huge 200-300pt title, centered)
  → Optional Shape with blur for contrast overlay

Example mapping:
  HTML: <div class="hero bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-900 to-purple-900">
  JSON: {"type": "Background", "props": {"backgroundType": "gradient", ...}}

PATTERN 2: GLASS CARD
Web thinking: Frosted glass effect with rounded corners, subtle border
Components:
  → Shape (rounded rectangle, blur effect, low opacity)
  → TiptapTextBlock (content inside card bounds)
  → Proper layering with zIndex

Glass card properties:
  - backgroundColor: white with 10-20% opacity (#FFFFFF with opacity 0.1-0.2)
  - blur: 10-20
  - borderRadius: 16-32
  - subtle border: 1px white 20% opacity
  - padding: 40-60px inside for text

PATTERN 3: STAT CARD GRID
Web thinking: Grid of 2×2 or 3×1 cards, evenly spaced
Components:
  → Multiple Shape components (cards) in grid formation
  → TiptapTextBlock inside each (huge number + small label)
  → Consistent sizing and gaps (60-80px between cards)

Grid calculation:
  3-column grid: cards at x=80, x=720, x=1360 (width 560px each)
  2×2 grid: x=140, x=1020 / y=300, y=700 (width 680px each)

PATTERN 4: SPLIT SCREEN
Web thinking: Two equal or asymmetric halves
Components:
  → Left section: group of components (text, shapes)
  → Right section: group of components (image, chart)
  → Optional dividing Line component

50/50 split: left side 0-960, right side 960-1920
60/40 split: left side 0-1150, right side 1150-1920
70/30 split: left side 0-1340, right side 1340-1920

PATTERN 5: FLOATING ELEMENTS
Web thinking: Absolute positioned elements with dramatic offset
Components:
  → Overlapping allowed (experimental branch!)
  → Large numbers floating over images
  → Text cards overlaying backgrounds
  → Use zIndex for layering (background=0, mid=10, top=20)

PATTERN 6: MODERN CARD STACK
Web thinking: Cards with subtle offset and shadow for depth
Components:
  → Multiple Shape components slightly offset
  → Shadow props for depth (shadowBlur: 40-60)
  → Each card has distinct content

PATTERN 7: INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS
Web thinking: Animated, interactive data displays
Components:
  → CustomComponent (JS-powered)
  → Full control over rendering
  → Use for: animated counters, interactive charts, particle effects, data viz

When to use CustomComponent:
  - Animated number counters
  - Interactive comparison sliders
  - Particle effects / animations
  - Complex data visualizations
  - Any JS-powered interactivity
  - Timeline animations
  - Progress indicators with animation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
💎 MODERN DESIGN PRINCIPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. SIZE HIERARCHY (Critical!)
   - Hero numbers: 200-350pt (massive impact)
   - Titles: 80-120pt
   - Subtitles: 48-64pt  
   - Body: 32-42pt
   - Labels: 24-28pt
   - Think 3-5x difference between levels

2. COLOR USAGE
   - Use theme colors strategically
   - Primary for main content
   - Accent for highlights (sparingly!)
   - White/light for contrast
   - 70% one color, 20% second, 10% accent

3. SPACING & RHYTHM
   - Use consistent gaps (40px, 60px, 80px)
   - Generous padding inside cards (40-60px)
   - Edge margins: 80-120px
   - Overlaps ARE allowed (experimental!) - use for drama

4. GLASSMORPHISM
   - White shapes with 10-20% opacity
   - Blur: 10-20
   - Subtle border
   - Works great over images/gradients

5. DEPTH & LAYERING
   - Use zIndex: background=0, mid=10, foreground=20
   - Shadows for elevation (40-60px blur)
   - Overlapping elements for drama
   - Multiple layers create richness

6. ASYMMETRY
   - Off-center compositions
   - 60/40 splits instead of 50/50
   - Diagonal arrangements
   - Negative space as design element

7. TYPOGRAPHY DRAMA
   - Mix font weights (light, bold, black)
   - Vary sizes dramatically
   - Use color for emphasis
   - Split text into styled segments

🚀 SLIDE LAYOUT PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TITLE SLIDE PATTERN:
Think: Apple keynote opening
- Full-bleed gradient background
- Massive title (200-300pt) centered or offset
- Subtitle below (60pt)
- Metadata at bottom (small, subtle)

- CustomComponent for interactive chart/viz
- Text summary on opposite side in cards
- Clean separation
Components: CustomComponent (chart) + Shape (card) + TiptapTextBlock

CONTENT SLIDE PATTERN:
Think: Modern blog layout
- Hero image or gradient top section
- Content in glass cards
- 2-3 cards max
- Generous spacing
Components: Background/Image + multiple glass card groups

COMPARISON SLIDE PATTERN:
Think: Side-by-side with clear separation
- 50/50 split with dividing line

Components: Shape (circles) + Line (connections) + TiptapTextBlock (labels)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 CUSTOMCOMPONENT POWER MOVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CustomComponents give you JavaScript power. Use them for:

1. ANIMATED COUNTERS
   - Numbers that count up
   - Progress bars
   - Percentage animations

2. INTERACTIVE CHARTS
   - Hover effects
   - Animated data entry
   - Custom visualizations

3. COMPARISON SLIDERS
   - Before/after
   - Side-by-side with drag handle

4. PARTICLE EFFECTS
   - Floating elements
   - Animated backgrounds
   - Visual interest

5. TIMELINES
   - Interactive progress
   - Click-through steps
   - Animated reveals

6. DATA VISUALIZATIONS
   - Custom layouts
   - Animated transitions
   - Interactive exploration

CustomComponent format:
- Must be named function: function render(props) {}
- Use React.createElement (NO JSX)
- Root element must have width: '100%', height: '100%'
- Can use state and updateState
- Keep code complete and balanced

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚡ CRITICAL RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. THEME COMPLIANCE
   - Use EXACT fonts from theme
   - Use EXACT colors from theme
   - Don't invent colors or fonts

2. COMPONENT SCHEMAS
   - Include ALL required fields
   - Follow exact property names
   - Respect min/max constraints

3. OVERLAPS ALLOWED
   - This is experimental branch
   - Dramatic overlaps for impact
   - Use zIndex for layering
   - Let elements overlap for modern look

4. SIZE GENEROUSLY
   - Make things BIGGER than you think
   - Hero numbers should dominate
   - Don't be timid with scale

5. LESS IS MORE
   - 3-5 elements per slide max
   - Each element should have purpose
   - Whitespace is your friend

6. BRAND CONSISTENCY
   - Logo on every slide (if provided)
   - Consistent positioning
   - Same corner throughout deck

7. COMPLETE CODE
   - All CustomComponent functions must be complete
   - No partial code or comments saying "add more"
   - Balanced braces and syntax

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your mission: Create slides that look like they belong in a modern
product launch, not a corporate PowerPoint from 2010.

Think Stripe's homepage, Apple's keynotes, Vercel's design system.

GO BIG. BE BOLD. MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL.

DESIGN CHALLENGE:

Slide Title: {slide_title}
Content: {slide_content}

THEME SYSTEM:
{theme_info}

AVAILABLE COMPONENTS:
{component_schemas}

DESIGN APPROACH:

1. VISUALIZE in your mind as a web page:
   - What sections would this have?
   - Hero section? Card grid? Split screen?
   - Where would elements float?
   - What creates drama and impact?

2. CHOOSE your pattern:
   - Title slide? → Hero pattern
   - Big number? → Stat pattern with CustomComponent counter
   - Data comparison? → Split screen with CustomComponent viz
   - Process steps? → Horizontal cards or CustomComponent timeline
   - Feature list? → Glass card grid

3. MAP to components:
   - Hero section → Background + huge TiptapTextBlock
   - Cards → Shape (glass effect) + TiptapTextBlock
   - Interactive elements → CustomComponent
   - Images → Image with ken-burns or masks
   - Dividers → Shape (line) or Line component

4. DESIGN with drama:
   - Make primary element HUGE (200-300pt)
   - Support with smaller elements
   - Use overlaps for impact (allowed!)
   - Layer with zIndex
   - Apply glass effects and shadows

5. OUTPUT perfect JSON following all schemas.

Remember: Think like designing a beautiful webpage, but output our component format.

Now create this slide with MAXIMUM IMPACT.
