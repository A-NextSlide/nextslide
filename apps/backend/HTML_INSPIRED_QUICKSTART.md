# HTML-Inspired Generation - Quick Start

## 🚀 What Was Built

A complete **Option B** implementation: HTML-inspired prompting that teaches models to think in web design patterns but output your JSON components.

### ✅ All Deliverables Complete

1. **System Prompt** (10,498 chars, 339 lines)
   - Teaches web design patterns → component mapping
   - 7 major patterns: Hero, Glass Cards, Split Screen, Floating, etc.
   - Modern effects: glassmorphism, gradients, overlaps
   - Slide-type specific guidance

2. **CustomComponent Library** (5 templates)
   - `animated_counter` - Animated numbers for stats
   - `comparison_slider` - Interactive before/after
   - `progress_timeline` - Animated roadmaps
   - `stat_card_grid` - Dashboard metrics
   - `particle_background` - Visual effects

3. **Design Pattern Examples** (6 patterns)
   - Complete JSON examples showing web → components
   - Hero Stat, Glass Card Grid, Split Screen, Floating Elements, Modern Title, Data Viz

4. **Generator Integration**
   - `HTMLInspiredSlideGenerator` wrapper
   - Plug-and-play with existing system
   - Slide-type aware prompting

5. **Test Suite** ✅ 6/6 tests passing
   - All templates validated
   - All patterns tested
   - Complete prompt assembly verified

## 🎯 Key Features

### Think Web, Output JSON
Models design using familiar patterns:
- "Hero section with gradient" → Background + TiptapTextBlock
- "Glass card grid" → Shape (blur, opacity) + Text
- "Split screen 60/40" → Components positioned 0-1150 and 1150-1920

### Interactive Components
Use `CustomComponents` for JS-heavy features:
- Animated counters ($2.4B counting up)
- Interactive sliders (45% → 95%)
- Timeline animations (Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4)
- Stat card grids (4 metrics, staggered reveal)

### Massive Impact
- 200-350pt for hero numbers
- 120-160pt for titles
- Overlaps encouraged (experimental branch)
- Dramatic visual hierarchy

### Investment Banker Quality
Think: McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, BCG, Apple keynotes
- Clean, sophisticated layouts
- Data-focused but beautiful
- Professional glassmorphism effects
- Bold typography

## 🎮 How to Use Right Now

### 1. Run the Test

```bash
cd apps/backend
python3 test_html_inspired_simple.py
```

Expected output: 6/6 tests passed ✅

### 2. Check Generated Examples

```bash
ls test_output/html_inspired_simple/

# You'll see:
# - system_prompt_*.txt
# - customcomponent_templates_*.json
# - design_patterns_*.json
# - complete_prompt_title_*.txt
# - complete_prompt_stat_*.txt
# - complete_prompt_data_*.txt
```

### 3. Integrate with Your Generator

```python
from agents.generation.html_inspired_generator import HTMLInspiredSlideGenerator

# Wrap your existing generator
html_generator = HTMLInspiredSlideGenerator(your_base_generator)

# Use as normal
async for event in html_generator.generate_slide(context):
    handle_event(event)
```

## 🎨 Example Patterns Generated

### Pattern 1: Hero Stat
```
Web Concept: Full-bleed gradient with massive centered number
Output: 2 components (Background gradient + CustomComponent counter)
Effect: $2.4B counting up with dramatic impact
```

### Pattern 2: Glass Card Grid
```
Web Concept: 2×2 grid of frosted glass cards
Output: 4 components (2 Shapes + 2 TiptapTextBlocks)
Effect: Modern glassmorphism with metrics
```

### Pattern 3: Split Screen
```
Web Concept: 50/50 split with divider
Output: 3 components (Shape divider + content both sides)
Effect: Clear side-by-side comparison
```

### Pattern 4: Floating Elements
```
Web Concept: Overlapping elements with z-index
Output: 3 components (Image + Shape + TiptapTextBlock)
Effect: Dramatic depth with layering
```

## 💡 Example CustomComponent

**Animated Counter** (1,882 chars):
```javascript
// Counts from 0 to target value with smooth animation
// Formats: 2.4B, 135M, 450K automatically
// Props: targetValue, prefix, suffix, label, duration
// State: currentValue (animated)
// Returns: Massive number (180pt) with label (36pt)
```

Usage in slide:
```json
{
  "type": "CustomComponent",
  "props": {
    "position": {"x": 660, "y": 340},
    "width": 600,
    "height": 400,
    "code": "/* animated_counter template */",
    "targetValue": 2400000000,
    "prefix": "$",
    "suffix": "B",
    "label": "Market Size"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Slide-Type Specific Guidance

The system automatically adapts prompts based on slide type:

| Type | Pattern | Key Components | Size |
|------|---------|----------------|------|
| **Title** | Modern Title | Background + huge text | 160-240pt |
| **Stat** | Hero Stat | animated_counter | 250-350pt |
| **Data** | Data Viz | CustomComponent chart + insights | 50-60% canvas |
| **Comparison** | Split Screen | Divider + mirrored content | 50/50 or 60/40 |
| **Process** | Timeline | progress_timeline CustomComponent | Full width |
| **Content** | Variable | Glass cards or floating | 2-3 elements |

## 🔥 Key Advantages

### vs Current System

| Aspect | Current | HTML-Inspired |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Thinking | Abstract x,y coords | Natural web patterns |
| Layouts | Basic splits | Hero, cards, grids, floating |
| Interactivity | Static | CustomComponent animations |
| Effects | Basic | Glassmorphism, overlaps, blur |
| Sizing | Conservative | Bold (2-3x larger) |
| Quality | Template-y | Behance-worthy |

### Why It Works

1. **Training Data**: Models have seen millions of web designs
2. **Natural Patterns**: Web thinking is intuitive for models
3. **Rich Effects**: CSS effects translate well to our components
4. **Overlap Freedom**: Experimental branch allows creativity
5. **Interactive**: CustomComponents add JS power

## 💬 Questions?

**Q: Will this work with my existing generator?**  
A: Yes! `HTMLInspiredSlideGenerator` wraps your existing generator and only changes the prompts.

**Q: Do I need to change my frontend?**  
A: No! It outputs the same component JSON your frontend already handles.

**Q: What if I don't want overlaps?**  
A: Adjust the system prompt. Overlaps are just encouraged, not required.

**Q: Can I add more CustomComponent templates?**  
A: Absolutely! Follow the pattern in `customcomponent_library.py`.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: The code is solid, but test with real generations first. This is experimental branch for a reason!
